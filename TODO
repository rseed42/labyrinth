1. Make car an octagon to look cool
2. Improve car dynamics:
    - gradual acceleration (not max)
    - brakes
    - experiment with values
    - think about general improvements
3. Start implementing an AI
4. Implement other static objects
5. Use a simple scenegraph, since this is already needed
6. Agent action log, so we can trace the decisions it made and its
   position/rotation
